Refactor Mission Control: Replaced 'Meetings' tab with 'Costs' tab.

Accomplishments:
1. Removed 'Meetings' Tab:
   - Deleted 'Meetings' tab button and entire content section.
   - Removed 'meetings', 'meetingsPast', 'meetingDraft', 'editingMeeting' state.
   - Removed 'Meeting', 'MeetingType', 'AgendaItem', 'ActionItem' types.
   - Removed 'Today' and 'Upcoming' widgets.
   - Removed auto-archive effect for meetings.

2. Added 'Costs' Tab:
   - Added 'Costs' tab button with icon 💸.
   - Implemented 'Costs' view (when `tab === 'costs'`).
   - Added logic to fetch `/mc/costs` when on the 'costs' tab (in addition to 'revenue' tab).
   - Created detailed view:
     - **Overview**: 3 MetricCards (Total Cost, Total Tokens, Budget Usage).
     - **Model Breakdown**: Table showing Model Name | Cost ($) | Usage Share %.
     - **Pricing Reference**: Static card showing assumed costs for popular models.

3. Visuals:
   - Maintained glassmorphism/card style.
   - Used `MetricCard` for KPIs.
   - Added a visual progress bar for budget usage.

The refactor is complete and ready for use.
